## Setting up a development environment

To contribute to `lihzahrd`, you'll need to use [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/).

1. Clone the git repo with the command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Steffo99/lihzahrd
   ```

2. Enter the new directory:

   ```shell
   cd lihzahrd
   ```

3. Install all dependencies and the package:

   ```shell
   poetry install
   ```

4. Activate the newly created virtual environment:

   ```shell
   $ poetry shell
   ```

Please note that for compatibility with PyPy, the project needs to target Python 3.6.
